# Dusty Blog
A simple blog app that probably won't get much love as I'm building it to practice.

## How To

You'll need to setup a .env file for your database connection

- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the cloned repo directory
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`
- The server should now be running on port 3000
- Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
